Goes together with the frontend at https://github.com/kwantton/FS-blog-frontend-part-5. Note: this had been originally git cloned by mistake from the phonebook app backend. However, I removed everything, then copy-pasted the files from https://studies.cs.helsinki.fi/stats/courses/fullstackopen/solutions/4 (part 4 model answers). Having tried this together with my frontend (in folder 'dist' here), adding a new blog now works (as does, of course, signing in before that as well).
